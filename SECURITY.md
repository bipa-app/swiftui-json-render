# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates for the latest `0.x` release line. If you
are using an older version, please upgrade to the most recent release before
reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to help protect users. Use one
of the following options:

- Open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred).
- If you cannot access GitHub Security Advisories, open a new issue and ask the
  maintainers to convert it to a private report.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code
- Affected versions and environments
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and aim to provide a status
update within 10 business days.
